Both site are multi-lingual application in English and French. Our Development Process We are following the Agile Model Technique in the development. \"Agile process model\" refers to a software development approach based on iterative development. By using Agile methods we will break tasks into smaller iterations. The project scope and requirements are laid down at the beginning of the development process. We will Plans regarding the number of iterations, the duration and the scope of each iteration are clearly defined in advance. Each iteration should considered as a short time \"frame\" in the Agile process model, which typically lasts from three to four weeks. The division of the entire project into smaller parts helps to minimize the project risk and to reduce the overall project delivery time requirements. Each iteration involves a team working through a full software development life cycle including planning, requirements analysis, design, coding, and testing before a working product is demonstrated to the client. Phases of Agile Model: We will follow the Following phases in the Agile model: Requirements gathering Design the requirements Construction/ iteration Testing/ Quality assurance Deployment Feedback Scrum We will follow the SCURM as Agile Testing Method SCRUM is an agile development process focused primarily on ways to manage tasks in team-based development conditions. There are three roles in it, and their responsibilities are: Scrum Master: The scrum can set up the master team, arrange the meeting and remove obstacles for the process Product owner: The product owner makes the product backlog, prioritizes the delay and is responsible for the distribution of functionality on each repetition. Scrum Team: The team manages its work and organizes the work to complete the sprint or cycle. UI/UX I have fully reviewed the UoM current website and found that the designer of the site completely ignored the UI/UX design techniques. In our company we start each application/website by following the latest design techniques are tools UI design and UX design are two of the most often confused terms in web and app design. They\u2019re usually placed together in a single term, UI/UX design. What is UI Design? Normally companies only work on the User Interface side of the application which includes the graphical layout of an application like, formate of the text they read, the images, sliders, text entry fields, and all the rest of the items the user interacts with. Also it includes layout, transitions, interface animations and every single micro-interaction. Any sort of visual element, interaction, or animation must all be designed. UI designers are basically graphic designers. They\u2019re concerned with aesthetics. It\u2019s up to them to make sure the application\u2019s interface is attractive, visually-stimulating and themed appropriately to match the purpose and/or personality of the app. And they need to make sure every single visual element feels united, both aesthetically, and in purpose. What is UX Design? We have skilled UX designers in our team which works \u201cUX\u201d stands for \u201cuser experience.\u201d A user\u2019s experience of the app is determined by how they interact with it. Is the experience smooth and intuitive or clunky and confusing? Does navigating the app feel logical or does it feel arbitrary? Does interacting with the app give people the sense that they\u2019re efficiently accomplishing the tasks they set out to achieve or does it feel like a struggle? User experience is determined by how easy or difficult it is to interact with the user interface elements that the UI designers have created. Photo by CareerFoundry So UX designers are also concerned with an application\u2019s user interface, and this is why people get confused about the difference between the two. But whereas UI designers are tasked with deciding how the user interface will look, UX designers are in charge of determining how the user interface operates. They determine the structure of the interface and the functionality. How it\u2019s organized and how all the parts relate to one another. In short, they design how the interface works. If it works well and feels seamless, the user will have a good experience. But if navigation is complicated or unintuitive, then a lousy user experience is likely. UX designers work to avoid the second scenario. How They Work Together So a UX designer decides how the user interface works while the UI designer decides how the user interface looks. This is a very collaborative process, and the two design teams tend to work closely together. Bootsrap We are using boostrap for UI responsive design as you know Bootstrap is a potent front-end framework used to create modern websites and web apps. It\u2019s open-source and free to use, yet features numerous HTML and CSS templates for UI interface elements such as buttons and forms. Bootstrap also supports JavaScript extensions. it has a lot of components, a good grid system, styling for many HTML elements ranging from typography to buttons, as well as support of JavaScript plugins, making it even more flexible. Bootstrap is great for creating layouts, as its responsive CSS is designed to conform to different devices. It can be employed to ensure consistency, eliminate cross-browser issues, and so on.
